                    I was there at MacWorld 2005 when you unveiled the "iPhone"
                    
                    
                    As a designer &amp; feature film editor and loyal customer to the amazing
                    company you built, I also felt as if you were another father to me. In my
                    lifetime, I've watched you touch so many people with your creativity, hard
                    work ethic and dedication to your fans. I'm not very religious, but I do
                    believe there is another life after one passes. My only wish is that you are
                    still watching down to see the amazing new breakthroughs and keynotes Apple
                    unveils in the future. I also want you to know that when I saw your death
                    announced on Apple.com, I saw it in Safari, on my MacBook Pro, while I was
                    listening to my iPod, playing "words with friends" on my iPhone 3GS and
                    (finally) working in Final Cut Pro.
                    
                    
                    I will always remember you as a pioneer and as a father of the modern
                    computer.

Mr. Jobs was the reason that I became interested in technology and the reason I am now pursuing a career in journalism, just to get the opportunity to report on tech. &nbsp;My first media player was the second gen Nano, and my first cell phone was the 3GS. &nbsp;Mr. Jobs and the innovations he pushed showed me just how beautiful and empowering modern technology can be. &nbsp;I'll always thank him and Apple for that.A great man died today, and the world will not be the same tomorrow. </p><p class="author" style="text-align: left; font-weight: lighter;color: gray;">Anonymous </p></article>

You are a genius. You set up Apple. You create iPhone, iPads I love them so much. They are excellent because of your ideas. I enjoy your videos,
                    the same they are excellent. I really hope that Apple will become better and
                     better without you. Though I know maybe you cannot see my letter, I want to say I love both you and apple.
                    When I know you have cancer I really feel surprised, in my mind you are healthy and full of energy. When I see you become thinner and thinner, I felt worried. Health is the most important thing, isn't it?
                    Though I am a Chinese, I write the letter in English, because you are a American, I really respect you. I love you.</p><p class="author" style="text-align: left; font-weight: lighter;color: gray;">Sunlight </p></article>
